 * Time-windowed provider substitution for one pi-ai model entry.

 * provider resolved from pi-ai's installed catalog. The route keeps its own
 * provider, endpoint, and display name, so the switch is invisible to the
 * session log: only the wire endpoint follows the active window.
 *
 * A window is a local wall-clock interval, evaluated in its own IANA zone so a
 * deployment's peak hours do not follow the host process's zone. Windows
 * are matched in configuration order and the first match wins, which is what
 * lets a later window carry a narrower interval.
